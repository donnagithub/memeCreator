# MemeCreator

MemeCreator allows users to upload an image and add text to that image. This provides a way for users to create memes that can then be uploaded to social media, such as Pinterest or Facebook.

There are four inputs: 

- the image file, which is copied into the public folder of the project
- the quote text, which is added to the image file at the point on the image that the user clicks on.
- the font for the quote, which is just a selection of 4 possible fonts for now.
- the color for the quote, which is just a selection of 4 possible colors for now.

The resulting combined image and text is saved into the public folder. 

Future enhancements include:

- allowing the translucency of the background image to be modified
- getting a list of available fonts and colors to populate the drop-down input lists
- specifying the font size of the quote text
- specifying the direction of the quote text
- allowing the quote text to be edited, even after saving (this will probably require that the image and text be stored separately)
- allowing the quote text to be moved on the background image
