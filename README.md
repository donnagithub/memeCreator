# MemeCreator

MemeCreator allows users to upload an image and add text to that image. This provides a way for users to create memes that can then be uploaded to social media, such as Pinterest or Facebook.

There are two inputs: 

- the image file, which is copied into the public/backgrounds folder of the project
- the quote text, which is added to the image file at the point on the image that the user clicks on.

The resulting combined image and text is saved into the public/memes folder. 

Future enhancements include:

- allowing the translucency of the background image to be modified
- specifying the font and size of the quote text
- specifying the color and direction of the quote text
- allowing the quote text to be edited, even after saving (this will probably require that the image and text be stored separately)
- allowing the quote text to be moved on the background image
