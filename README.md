# MemeCreator

MemeCreator allows users to upload an image and add text to that image. This provides a way for users to create memes that can then be uploaded to social media, such as Pinterest or Facebook.

There are five inputs: 

- the image file, which is loaded into a canvas on the screen
- the quote text, which is added to the image 
- the font for the quote, which is just a selection of 4 possible fonts for now
- the font size for the quote, which is just a selection of 5 possible sizes for now
- the color for the quote, which is just a selection of 4 possible colors for now

The resulting meme is a combination of the uploaded image and the quote text, and can be saved by the user by right-clicking the meme image. 

Future enhancements include:

- providing a way to reset the image and modify the quote inputs without refreshing the browser
- allowing the translucency of the background image to be modified
- getting a list of available fonts, font sizes, and colors to populate the drop-down input lists
- specifying the direction of the quote text
- allowing the user to click on the image to place the quote text
